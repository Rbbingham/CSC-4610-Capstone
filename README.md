<!-- PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS -->
## Project Specifications
The concept of our project involves the addition of quality checks on an SQL-based database, ultimately displaying the results of the quality checks in a presentable manner through Power BI. When large amounts of data are passed through a daily “refresh” of data for the clients to view, sometimes the data does not pass correctly. A series of quality checks will be instated to ensure that the data passed through is neither too little (e.g., missing data) nor too much (e.g. duplicate data, or data that is not necessary to refresh). These results will be viewable through the Power BI interface by Transcard. These results should be filterable, allowing Transcard to compare data against multiple dates rather than just viewing single dates. The Transcard team should be notified once the quality check is completed or when something has not been refreshed correctly.
